Enhanced Smart Stick for Visually Impaired Users
This project developed a smart assistive navigation device designed to improve obstacle and water detection for visually impaired individuals. The system integrates ultrasonic sensors, water sensors, and a vibration motor, all controlled by an Arduino Mega (ATmega2560). It was built as a final-year undergraduate project in Computer Engineering at All Nations University.

The smart stick emits alerts via vibration based on proximity to obstacles or puddles. It is designed to be low-cost, user-friendly, and lightweight for daily use. Testing showed a system accuracy of 94%, with variable vibration intensity based on obstacle distance or water depth. The solution aims to offer an affordable, enhanced alternative to traditional white canes or expensive guide dog systems.

Key features include object detection, puddle sensing, vibration feedback, and a compact embedded circuit. The system achieved strong real-time performance and usability during indoor and outdoor trials.
